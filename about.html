      <p>At Omnivio, we believe that oxygen is omnipotent — a vital, transformative force at the core of life itself.</p>
      <p>Our journey into the hyperbaric wellness space began with a simple question: What if we could use the most essential element on Earth to help people heal, recover, and thrive? That question became our mission.</p>
      <p>"Omnivio" is born from the words omni (all) and vita (life), reflecting our commitment to supporting full-spectrum wellness. We envision a world where advanced oxygen therapy is not just a luxury, but a powerful, accessible tool for longevity, resilience, and optimized living.</p>
      <p>With every chamber we create and every client we serve, our purpose remains the same: to help people feel better, recover faster, and live more fully — one breath at a time.</p>
