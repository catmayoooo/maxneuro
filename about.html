          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>

          <h2>Why We Started</h2>
          <p>
            Max Neuro Supply was founded after witnessing a major challenge across neuro-diagnostic practices: critical tools were either difficult to access, inconsistent in quality, or priced beyond reach. Clinicians were forced to choose between affordability and reliability — a choice no medical professional should ever have to make. <br> We saw an opportunity to change that. By combining accessible pricing with uncompromising standards, we set out to deliver neuro-diagnostic equipment that practitioners could rely on every single day. Our goal was — and still is — to close the gap between what clinicians need and what was previously available to them. <br> At our core, we are driven by empathy for the practitioners who depend on these tools, the patients whose diagnoses rely on them, and the belief that better equipment leads to better outcomes. This is why we started, and this is why we continue to grow.
